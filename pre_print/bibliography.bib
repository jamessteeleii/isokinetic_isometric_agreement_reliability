  abstract = {Test--retest is a concept that is routinely evaluated during the validation phase of many measurement tools. However, this term covers at least two related but very different concepts: reliability and agreement. Reliability is the ability of a measure applied twice upon the same respondents to produce the same ranking on both occasions. Agreement requires the measurement tool to produce twice the same exact values. An analysis of research papers showed that the distinction between both concepts remains anything but clear, and that the current practice is to evaluate reliability only, generally on the basis of the sole Pearson's correlation. This practice is very problematic in the context of longitudinal studies because it becomes difficult to determine whether a difference between two successive observations is attributable to a real change of the respondents or only to the characteristics of the measurement tool, which then leads to a possible misinterpretation of the results. More focus should be given on the real interpretation of linear correlation, and when agreement is required in addition to reliability, then correct alternative, such as the Bland--Altman plot, should be more generally used.},

J Strength Cond Res 30(11): 3261-3265, 2016-The aim of this study was to investigate the test-retest reliability of a novel multijoint isokinetic squat device. The subjects in this study were 10 strength-trained athletes. Each subject completed 3 maximal testing sessions to assess peak concentric and eccentric force (N) over a 3-week period using the Exerbotics squat device. Mean differences between eccentric and concentric force across the trials were calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficients of variation (CVs) for the variables of interest were calculated using an excel reliability spreadsheet. Between trials 1 and 2 an 11.0 and 2.3\% increase in mean concentric and eccentric forces, respectively, was reported. Between trials 2 and 3 a 1.35\% increase in the mean concentric force production and a 1.4\% increase in eccentric force production was reported. The mean concentric peak force CV and ICC across the 3 trials was 10\% (7.6-15.4) and 0.95 (0.87-0.98) respectively. However, the mean eccentric peak force CV and ICC across the trials was 7.2\% (5.5-11.1) and 0.90 (0.76-0.97), respectively. Based on these findings it is suggested that the Exerbotics squat device shows good test-retest reliability. Therefore practitioners and investigators may consider its use to monitor changes in concentric and eccentric peak force.},

Thirty participants underwent 8 weeks of lower-extremity progressive resistance training performed 3 times per week designed to promote muscular strength and power. These subjects were randomly assigned to a morning training group (MTG, 07:00-08:00 hours, n = 10), an evening training group (ETG, 17:00-18:00 hours, n = 10), and a control group (CG, completed all tests but did not train, n = 10). Performance in the squat jump, the countermovement jump, the Wingate and 1 repetition maximum (1RM) during leg extension, leg curl, and squat tests was recorded just before and 2 weeks after an 8-week course of regular training. For all the subjects, the morning and evening tests were scheduled at the same time of the day as for the morning and evening training sessions. Before training, the results indicated a significant increase in performance from morning to evening tests (ca. 2.84-17.55\% for all tests) for all groups. After training, the diurnal variations in anaerobic performances were blunted in the MTG. In fact, there was no significant difference in muscular power or strength between morning and evening tests. However, these intradaily variations in anaerobic performances persisted in the ETG and CG. From a practical point of view, adaptation to strength training is greater at the time of the day at which training was scheduled than at other times.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the level of scientific evidence and the place in the rehabilitation framework of isokinetic muscle strengthening (IMS) for knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: A systematic review of the English literature in MEDLINE via PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and PEDro databases for only randomized comparative trials. Data that were sufficiently homogeneous underwent comprehensive meta-analysis. Methodological assessment was done by using the CLEAR scale for non-pharmacologic trials. RESULTS: We identified articles for 9 trials (696 patients). All trials were of low to moderate quality. Tolerance of IMS was considered good. Improvement in muscle strength was better with an IMS program than no treatment or an isometric exercise but did not differ with an aerobic program. We found an important effect for pain (standardized mean difference 1.218 [95\% CI 0.899-1.54], P{$<$}0.001) and functional Lequesne index (1.61 [0.40-2.81], P=0.009) and a moderate effect for the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscore C for disability (0.58 [0.04-1.11], P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: IMS is an effective way to propose dynamic muscle strengthening for knee OA rehabilitation and has a significant effect on pain and disability. Because of the weak methodology and the great heterogeneity of studies, particularly in IMS protocol and outcome measures, insufficient data are available to provide guidelines about efficacy and strategy. Future clinical trials are needed, but more attention should be paid to the methods of such studies to clarify the role of IMS in the therapeutic armamentarium of knee OA.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(2): 587-601, 2020-Angular isokinetic dynamometry (AID) is widely regarded as the gold standard for dynamic muscle performance testing. Based on the rotational movement of its actuator, AID targets "single-joint" (knee, shoulder, hip, etc.) configurations namely measurement of muscle potential while it moves the lever arm-limb assembly ostensibly around a single fixed axis. On the other hand, the application of multiple-joint isokinetic dynamometry (MID) is relatively narrow, both in research and in practice. This situation is due, possibly, to the fact that these dynamometers are generally more limited in scope namely to testing/conditioning of combined hip, knee, ankle motion (leg press), combined shoulder, elbow motion, and lifting motion patterns, despite the fact that all 3 are associated with higher functionality. However, with the emerging importance of MID, this critical review takes a fresh look at its various aspects including the terminology and classification of multiple-joint isokinetic dynamometers; the problem of scaling namely the need to adjust the range of motion and linear velocities to subjective anthropometric measures; specific technical and methodological issues that underlie the valid application of these dynamometers; available reference values; and the reproducibility of MID-based test findings. Analysis of these topics indicates that MID may validly and effectively be applied for the assessment and conditioning of specific muscle action patterns. However, there is a clear need for standardization of tests and for conditioning protocols alongside research into the use of this method in various clinical cohorts.},

We further examined between-day variability of high intensity functional strength and endurance performance testing with and without VE. Nineteen experienced athletes (seven females and 12 males, age: 23.7 {\textpm} 4.3 years) performed a standardized one repetition maximum (1 RM) squat test and a 12-min high-intensity functional training (HIFT) workout [as many repetitions as possible (AMRAP)] on four different days over a 2-week period. Athletes randomly performed each test twice, either with VE or without (CON), with a minimum of 72 h rest between tests. Very good to excellent relative between-day reliability with slightly better values for strength testing (ICC: 0.99; CV: 3.5-4.1\%) compared to endurance testing (ICC 0.87-0.95; CV: 3.9-7.3\%) were observed. Interestingly, VE led to higher reliability during endurance testing. Mean squat strength depicted higher strength values with VE (107 {\textpm} 33 kg) compared to CON (105 {\textpm} 33 kg; p = 0.009, Cohen's d: 0.06). AMRAP in the endurance test showed negligible differences between VE (182 {\textpm} 33 AMRAP) and CON (181 {\textpm} 35 AMRAP; p = 0.71, Cohen's d: 0.03). In conclusion, the effects of VE do not notably exceed day-to-day variability during high intensity functional strength (CV: 3.5-4.1\%) and endurance (CV: 3.9-7.3\%) testing. However, high intensity functional strength and endurance testing with VE seems to be slightly more reliable, particularly during endurance testing.},

Subjects reported to the Human Performance Laboratory on 5 occasions during this period, separated by 72 hours, for a testing and exercise session on an isokinetic chest press device. After each exercise protocol, subjects rated their fatigue and muscle soreness on a 15-cm visual analog scale. Subjects then consumed no daily BET for 4 weeks but maintained familiarity with the exercise device once per week. After the washout period, subjects resumed the BET protocol using the opposite drink and repeated the same 15-day protocol. No differences were noted in maximum CON force output between pre (335.9 {\textpm} 78.3 and 321.6 {\textpm} 63.6 N) and post (330.3 {\textpm} 74.8 and 330.2 {\textpm} 71.6 N) workouts in both BET and PL, respectively.

  abstract = {Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test, assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical settings. The main measures of reliability are within-subject random variation, systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple, adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants. Uses of reliability include decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the standard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.},

We meta-analysed these measures for power or work from 101 studies of healthy adults. Measures and tests with the smallest CV in exercise of a given duration include field tests of sprint running (approximately 0.9\%), peak power in an incremental test on a treadmill or cycle ergometer (approximately 0.9\%), equivalent mean power in a constant-power test lasting 1 minute to 3 hours on a treadmill or cycle ergometer (0.9 to 2.0\%), lactate-threshold power (approximately 1.5\%), and jump height or distance (approximately 2.0\%). The CV for mean power on isokinetic ergometers was relatively large ({$>$} 4\%). CV were larger for nonathletes versus athletes (1.3 x), female versus male nonathletes (1.4 x), shorter (approximately 1-second) and longer (approximately 1-hour) versus 1-minute tests ({$<$} or = 1.6 x), and respiratory- versus ergometer-based measures of power (1.4 to 1.6 x).

These findings should help exercise practitioners and researchers select or design good measures and protocols for tests of physical performance.},

  abstract = {Background Currently, we are not aware of a method to assess graphically on one simple plot agreement between more than two observers making continuous measurements on the same subjects.Methods We aimed to develop a simple graphical method to assess agreement between multiple observers using continuous measurements. The Bland--Altman graphical method for assessing agreement between two observers using continuous measures was modified and extended to accommodate multiple observers. Mathematical formulae are derived and real data examples used to illustrate the proposed method.Results The examples show that the proposed graphical method of assessing agreement provides clinically useful information. This information includes estimates of the limits of agreement with the mean and a visual means for determining these limits over the range of measurements. In a data example that included five readers' measurements of 40 lung lesions, the intra-class correlation (ICC) was 0.84 indicating readers can reliably measure the lesions. However, the estimated limits of agreement with the mean were -1.1 to 1.1\,cm implying that the readers' measurements can plausibly differ from the mean estimated tumour size by more than 1\,cm. This is a clinically significant difference according to the study authors. In addition, a plot of the limits of agreement with the mean by mean tumour size shows heterogeneous agreement presumably due to the varying degrees of definition at the edge of the lesions.Conclusions The proposed graphical method of assessing agreement can be used alongside other measures such as ICC for reporting on reproducibility in studies of multiple observers making continuous measurements.},

The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the diurnal variation in maximum endurance and strength performance. METHODS: The databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from inception to November 2020. The search string was externally reviewed according to PRESS guidelines, and the review was conducted in accordance to PRISMA guidelines and registered beforehand on PROSPERO. Eligibility criteria were that 1) the studies included humans and 2) any kind of maximum endurance or maximum strength test was performed at 3) a minimum of three different times of the day. There were no restrictions regarding study design, participants' sex, age, or fitness levels. RESULTS: From 10,460 screened articles, 63 articles met all three inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis on the harmonizable 29 studies provided evidence for diurnal variations in physical performance. In detail, the overall effect sizes (95\% confidence intervals) were 0.23 (0.05-0.40), 0.73 (0.37-1.09), 0.39 (0.18-0.60), and 0.79 (0.28-1.30) for endurance exercise tests, maximum power output in the Wingate test, handgrip strength, and jump height, respectively, all in favor of higher performance in the evening. The overall risk of bias in individual studies was moderately high. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence that anaerobic power and jump height are maximal between 1300 and 2000 h. There is some evidence that handgrip strength peaks between 1400 and 2100 h, but only little evidence that there is a time of peak performance in maximum endurance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS: There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections. DISCUSSION FOR READERS: When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. CONCLUSION: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

Since strength measurement directly at the muscle is (currently) not feasible, it is usually done at the outside of the body, at the interface with some kind of a dynamometer. This poses various challenges because of difficult mechanical and physiological modelling of the conditions, and because of difficulties in experimental control. To better understand and measure human motor performance, a model of muscle functions and control is discussed, and means for computer-aided position and motion observation are proposed. Experimental variables are classified, and a taxonomy for static (isometric) and several dynamic measurement techniques is described.},

Intraclass correlation techniques were used to partition error variance and true score variance estimates on 75 college females classified into high, middle, and low levels of absolute strength groups; 30 male subjects were also included. Data were analyzed for left and right wrists for the female subjects and for the right wrist of males. The low strength females demonstrated the smallest error variance estimates for trials and days on both wrists. Middle and high strength females exhibited error variance estimates two to three times larger than the low strength females. Right wrist data on male subjects showed the largest error variance, with trials and day error variances some two to four times larger than the female subjects. Since error variance seems to be related to the magnitude of the strength score, further caution is indicated in the interpretation of reliability estimates for strength measures expressed in the form of a single reliability coefficient. The possibility that the importance of motivation in reliable assessment of maximal isometric strength may have been exaggerated was also discussed.}

  abstract = {Muscle strength, the maximal force-generating capacity of a muscle or group of muscles, is regularly assessed in physiological experiments and clinical trials. An understanding of the expected variation in strength and the factors that contribute to this variation is important when designing experiments, describing methodologies, interpreting results, and attempting to replicate methods of others and reproduce their findings. In this review (Cores of Reproducibility in Physiology), we report on the intra- and inter-rater reliability of tests of upper and lower limb muscle strength and voluntary activation in humans. Isometric, isokinetic, and isoinertial strength exhibit good intra-rater reliability in most samples (correlation coefficients {$\geq$}0.90). However, some tests of isoinertial strength exhibit systematic bias that is not resolved by familiarization. With the exception of grip strength, few attempts have been made to examine inter-rater reliability of tests of muscle strength. The acute factors most likely to affect muscle strength and serve as a source of its variation from trial-to-trial or day-to-day include attentional focus, breathing technique, remote muscle contractions, rest periods, temperature (core, muscle), time of day, visual feedback, body and limb posture, body stabilization, acute caffeine consumption, dehydration, pain, fatigue from preceding exercise, and static stretching {$>$}60 s. Voluntary activation, the nervous system's ability to drive a muscle to create its maximal force, exhibits good intra-rater reliability when examined with twitch interpolation (correlation coefficients {$>$}0.80). However, inter-rater reliability has not been formally examined. The methodological factors most likely to influence voluntary activation are myograph compliance and sensitivity; stimulation location, intensity, and inadvertent stimulation of antagonists; joint angle (muscle length); and the resting twitch.},

However, knowledge of the ECC:CON strength ratio is incomplete and might inform resistance exercise prescriptions. Our purposes were to determine the magnitude of the ECC:CON ratio of human skeletal muscle in vivo and explore if sex, age, joint actions/exercises, and movement velocity impact it. A total of 340 studies were identified through searches. It was possible to analyse 1516 ECC:CON ratios, aggregated from 12,546 individuals who made up 564 groups in 335 of the identified studies. Approximately 98\% of measurements occurred on isokinetic machines. Bayesian meta-analyses were performed using log-ratios as response variables then exponentiated back to raw ratios. The overall main model estimate for the ECC:CON ratio was 1.41 (95\% credible interval [CI] 1.38-1.44). The ECC:CON ratio was slightly less in men (1.38 [CI 1.34-1.41]) than women (1.47 [CI 1.43-1.51]), and greater in older adults~(1.62 [CI 1.57-1.68]) than younger adults (1.39 [CI 1.36-1.42]). The ratio was similar between grouped upper-body (1.42 [CI 1.38-1.46]) and lower-body joint actions/exercises (1.40 [CI 1.37-1.44]). However, heterogeneity in the ratio existed across joint actions/exercises, with point estimates ranging from 1.32 to 2.61. The ECC:CON ratio was most greatly impacted by movement velocity, with a 0.20\% increase in the ratio for every 1{$^\circ$}/s increase in velocity. The results show that~ECC muscle~strength is\,{\textasciitilde}\,40\% greater than CON muscle~strength. However, the ECC:CON ratio is greatly affected by movement velocity and to lesser extents age and sex. Differences between joint actions/exercises likely exist, but more data are needed to provide more precise estimates.},

The total work volume (repetitions {\texttimes} sets {\texttimes} load) was equated between groups. Training was performed three times a week for 8 weeks. Before and after the training period, participants were tested for VO2max, body composition, 1 RM on the bench press, knee extension and squat. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare post training values between groups, using baseline values as covariates. According to the results, both groups decreased body fat and increased fat free mass with no difference between them. Whilst both groups significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness and maximal strength, the improvements in MJ group were higher than for SJ in VO2max (5.1 and 12.5\% for SJ and MJ), bench press 1 RM (8.1 and 10.9\% for SJ and MJ), knee extension 1 RM (12.4 and 18.9\% for SJ and MJ) and squat 1 RM (8.3 and 13.8\% for SJ and MJ). In conclusion, when total work volume was equated, RT programs involving MJ exercises appear to be more efficient for improving muscle strength and maximal oxygen consumption than programs involving SJ exercises, but no differences were found for body composition.},

As there is a loss of strength in elderly, many treatments are based on delaying the loss of strength or maintaining it. Isokinetic dynamometry is the gold standard for assessing strength. It is essential that studies are conducted to allow us to identify the reliability of isokinetic strength assessments in older people. This study aimed to test the absolute and relative intra-session reliability of peak torque and work of a concentric knee extension-flexion performed at 60{$^\circ$}/s in elderly. Fifty-two elderly subjects performed three repetitions of bilateral concentric knee extension-flexion at 60{$^\circ$}/s using an isokinetic dynamometer. The relative and absolute reliability were calculated between the second and third repetition. The intra-class correlation coefficient values were between 0.94 and 0.98 for peak torque and work in all measures, which is considered ``excellent'', except for left leg flexors in women, with values between 0.85 and 0.88, which is considered ``good''. The standard error of measurement (SEM) percentage oscillated from 3.9\% to 10.5\%, with a smallest real difference (SRD) percentage of 10.9\% to 29.2\% for peak torque. The relative reliability of peak torque and work were excellent for all measures except flexors in women, evidencing the utility of isokinetic dynamometry for monitoring lower limb maximal muscle strength and work of concentric knee extension-flexion at 60{$^\circ$}/s/s in the elderly. In addition, an SRD {$>$} 19.9\% in peak torque and an SRD {$>$} 23.1\% in work is considered a true change.},

Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the magnitude of isokinetic and dynamic one repetition-maximum (1RM) strength and local muscular endurance increases after 6 weeks of multiple-joint isokinetic resistance training. Seventeen women were randomly assigned to either an isokinetic resistance training group (IRT) or a non-exercising control group (CTL). The IRT group underwent 6 weeks of training (2 days per week) consisting of 5 sets of 6-10 repetitions at 75-85\% of subjects' peak strength for the isokinetic chest press and seated row exercises at an average linear velocity of 0.15 m s(-1) [3-sec concentric (CON) and 3-sec eccentric (ECC) phases]. Peak CON and ECC force during the chest press and row, 1RM bench press and bent-over row, and maximum number of modified push-ups were assessed pre and post training. A 2 x 2 analysis of variance with repeated measures and Tukey's post hoc tests were used for data analysis. The results showed that 1RM bench press (from 38.6 {\textpm} 6.7 to 43.0 {\textpm} 5.9 kg), 1RM bent-over row (from 40.4 {\textpm} 7.7 to 45.5 {\textpm} 7.5 kg), and the maximal number of modified push-ups (from 39.5 {\textpm} 13.6 to 55.3 {\textpm} 13.1 repetitions) increased significantly only in the IRT group. Peak isokinetic CON and ECC force in the chest press and row significantly increased in the IRT group. No differences were shown in the CTL group for any measure. These data indicate 6 weeks of multiple-joint isokinetic resistance training increases dynamic muscle strength and local muscular endurance performance in addition to specific isokinetic strength gains in women. Key pointsMultiple-joint isokinetic resistance training increases dynamic maximal muscular strength, local muscular endurance, and maximal isokinetic strength in women.Multiple-joint isokinetic resistance training increased 1RM strength in the bench press (by 10.2\%), bent-over barbell row (by 11.2\%), and maximal modified push-up performance (by 28.6\%) indicating a carryover of training effects to dynamic exercise performance.The carryover effects may be attractive to strength training and conditioning professionals seeking to include alternative modalities such as multiple-joint isokinetic dynamometers to resistance training programs.},

Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate the effects of a novel, four-week, gymnastic-specific, eccentric--isokinetic (0.1 m/s) cluster training on a computer-controlled training device on the improvement of two static strength elements on rings (swallow and support scale). Nine elite male gymnasts participated in this study. Outcome parameters were maximum strength and strength endurance in maintaining the static position of both elements. After four weeks of training, specific maximum strength increased significantly (swallow: +4.1\%; d = 0.85; p = 0.01; support scale: +3.6\%; d = 2.47; p = 0.0002) and strength endurance tended to improve (swallow: +104.8\%; d = 0.60; p = 0.07; support scale: +26.8\%; d = 0.27; p = 0.19). Our results demonstrate that top athletes can considerably improve ring-specific strength and strength endurance in only four weeks. We assumed that the high specificity but also the unfamiliar stimulus of slow eccentric movements with very long times under maximal muscle tension led to these improvements. We suggest to use this type of training periodically and during phases in which the technical training load is low.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis has become commonplace within sport and exercise science for synthesising and summarising empirical studies. However, most research in the field focuses upon mean effects, particularly the effects of interventions to improve outcomes such as fitness or performance. It is thought that individual responses to interventions vary considerably. Hence, interest has increased in exploring precision or personalised exercise approaches. Not only is the mean often affected by interventions, but variation may also be impacted. Exploration of variation in studies such as randomised controlled trials (RCTs) can yield insight into interindividual heterogeneity in response to interventions and help determine generalisability of effects. Yet, larger samples sizes than those used for typical mean effects are required when probing variation. Thus, in a field with small samples such as sport and exercise science, exploration of variation through a meta-analytic framework is appealing. Despite the value of embracing and exploring variation alongside mean effects in sport and exercise science, it is rarely applied to research synthesis through meta-analysis. We introduce and evaluate different effect size calculations along with models for meta-analysis of variation using relatable examples from resistance training RCTs.},

  abstract = {The ability to examine force curves from multiple-joint assessments combines many of the benefits of dynamic constant external resistance exercise and isokinetic dynamometry. The purpose of this investigation was to examine test-retest reliability statistics for peak and mean force using the Exerbotics eSQ during maximal concentric and eccentric squats. Seventeen resistance-trained men (mean{\textpm}SD age=21{\textpm}2 years) visited the laboratory on two occasions. For each trial, the subjects performed two maximal concentric and eccentric squats, and the muscle actions with the highest force values were analyzed. There were no mean differences between the trials (P{$>$}.05), and the effect sizes were {$<$}0.12. When the entire force curve was examined, the intraclass correlation coefficients (model 2,1) and standard errors of measurement, respectively, were concentric peak force=0.743 (8.8\%); concentric mean force=0.804 (6.0\%); eccentric peak force=0.696 (10.6\%); eccentric mean force=0.736 (9.6\%). These findings indicated moderate-to-high reliability for the peak and mean force values obtained from the Exerbotics eSQ during maximal squat testing. The analysis of force curves from multiple-joint testing provides researchers and practitioners with a reliable means of assessing performance, especially during concentric muscle actions.},

  abstract = {Isometric assessment of muscular function is a popular form of testing which has been used in exercise science for over 40 years. It typically involves a maximal voluntary contraction performed at a specified joint angle against an unyielding resistance which is in series with a strain gauge, cable tensiometer, force platform or similar device whose transducer measures the applied force. Often both the maximum force and the rate of force development are recorded. These tests have generally shown high reliability in both single and multi-joint test protocols, although the maximum force is typically more reliable than rate of force development. This review outlines the reliability of isometric assessment and discusses a number of methodological considerations designed to enhance reliability and validity, including standardisation procedures, type of instructions, muscular pre-tension, testing position and joint angle. Currently, there appears to be considerable controversy as to the external validity of isometric assessment, particularly the ability of the tests to monitor changes in dynamic performance and their relationship to such performances. Indeed, a number of studies have recently shown that dynamic assessment modalities (isokinetic and isoinertial) are superior in terms of their relationship to dynamic performance and ability to discriminate between athletes of various performance levels compared with isometric assessment. This article reviews the use of isometric assessment in exercise science and consequently outlines a number of neural, mechanical and methodological factors which may have contributed to the contrasting research, and which may limit the ability of isometric assessment to relate to dynamic movement. Because of the large neural and mechanical differences between isometric and dynamic muscular actions, athletic assessment, which is dynamic in its nature, is generally most appropriately accomplished using dynamic muscular assessment methods, and in most instances isometric testing should be avoided.},
